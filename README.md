# Summary

This app was particularly challenging when trying to think about the order of the operation for the basic calculations being performed. I tried a few different approaches with objects and arrays for the input values. However, I ended up just using two variables for the entered values being calculated that would cycle from the first and second values based on the operators being passed. This would then update the result so that when the equals function was called the result was ready to be displayed. Figuring out how I could store the numbers and have them interact with the operator properly to give the correct result was the most difficult part of the build.

Though this doesnâ€™t account for more complex orders of operation such as brackets, I found this to challenge my problem-solving skills of getting the proper numbers for calculating the equations.

I also pushed myself to try and break this application up into more functions that did fewer things and did them well. This was helpful in establishing the global and function scopes of variables.

CSS is still challenging and seeing inspiration for what something could look like and investigating how to make that possible was an enjoyable, albeit difficult endeavour. Also, in this same vein understanding flexbox and flex items and how items behave when they have become flex items and getting the flex directions when there are multiple nested flexbox objects took some time to get right. I don't claim originality with the design but saw something I liked and tried to make it look similar to what I saw.
